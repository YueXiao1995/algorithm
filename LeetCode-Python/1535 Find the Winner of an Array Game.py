"""
Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0 and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.

Return the integer which will win the game.

It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

Example 1:
    Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
    Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
      1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
      2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
      3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
      4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
    So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.

Example 2:
    Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.

Example 3:
    Input: arr = [1,9,8,2,3,7,6,4,5], k = 7
    Output: 9

Example 4:
    Input: arr = [1,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99], k = 1000000000
    Output: 99

Constraints:
    2 <= arr.length <= 10^5
    1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
    arr contains distinct integers.
    1 <= k <= 10^9
